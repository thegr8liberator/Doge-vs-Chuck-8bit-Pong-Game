# Doge vs. Chuck 8bit Pong Game


## Overview

**Doge vs. Chuck 8bit Pong Game** is a retro-inspired Pong game featuring the legendary Chuck Norris and the internet sensation Doge. The game is designed to be both nostalgic and fun, offering a classic arcade-style experience with a modern twist.

## How It Works

### Game Mechanics

- **Single-Player Mode:** In this mode, you control Doge with the `W` and `S` keys. Chuck Norris is controlled by AI, and the goal is to outscore your opponent by making sure the ball passes through the opponent's side.
  
- **Multi-Player Mode:** In multiplayer mode, one player controls Doge using the `W` and `S` keys, while the other player controls Chuck Norris using the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.

- **Scoring:** The first player to reach 6 points wins the game. Each time the ball passes through a playerâ€™s side, the opposing player scores a point.

### Animations

- **Doge Animation:** Doge transitions from `doge still.png` to `doge kick.png` when hitting the ball and then back to `doge still.png`.
